# KittyCat's Say Cheese Project: Catch the Mouse

This is a simple project that I made for the Say Cheese YSWS! I really enjoyed the project and I learned a lot of new things. Before doing this project, I didn't realize that you could fit an html file in a qr code without using a hyper-link. It's actually pretty amazing. I also learned that you could embed svgs directly into html, which is also pretty cool. In this game, the objective is to try to catch the mouse...but I'll let you in on a little secret: it's impossible!! Try and prove me wrong though!
